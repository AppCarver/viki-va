# V.I.K.I. (Virtual Intelligent **Kinetic Interface**)

### Your Modular, Open-Source Virtual Assistant Framework Focused on Intelligent Action

---

## üöÄ Overview

**V.I.K.I.** is a highly modular and extensible **Virtual Assistant (VA) framework** designed to empower developers and organizations to build intelligent, conversational AI agents with unparalleled flexibility and, crucially, **a strong emphasis on actionable intelligence**. Built on a microservices architecture, V.I.K.I. decouples core VA functionalities into independent services, making it easy to integrate new capabilities, swap out components, and scale with your needs.

Beyond just understanding conversations, V.I.K.I.'s **Kinetic Interface** sets it apart by focusing on the seamless execution of real-world or digital actions. It provides the robust foundation for the next generation of conversational AI that doesn't just talk, but also *does*.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Modular Microservices Architecture:** Easily scale, update, and deploy individual components without affecting the entire system.
* **Intelligent Language Understanding:** Leverage advanced NLU capabilities to interpret user intent, extract entities, and understand sentiment.
* **Dynamic Dialogue Management:** Manage complex conversations, maintain context, and guide users through multi-turn interactions.
* **Powerful Action Execution Engine:** **Seamlessly integrate with external APIs and services to perform real-world tasks, making V.I.K.I. an agent of change.** This is where V.I.K.I.'s 'Kinetic' ability truly shines.
* **Comprehensive Memory Systems:** Utilize both short-term memory for immediate context and long-term memory for personalized, persistent knowledge.
* **Pluggable Components:** Swap out NLU models, memory databases, or integration points to tailor V.I.K.I. to your specific requirements.
* **Clear Data Models:** Standardized data structures ensure seamless communication between services.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture at a Glance

V.I.K.I.'s core strength lies in its distributed, decoupled architecture. The system is comprised of several specialized services that communicate via message queues and APIs, orchestrated by the central "Brain" components.

Key architectural principles include:

* **Input Processor:** Standardizes raw user input from various channels.
* **Language Center:** Handles Natural Language Understanding (NLU) ‚Äì intent recognition, entity extraction.
* **Prefrontal Cortex:** The core decision-making unit, managing dialogue flow and action selection.
* **Short-Term Memory:** Stores immediate conversational context.
* **Long-Term Memory:** Manages persistent user data, facts, and knowledge.
* **Action Executor:** **The dedicated component responsible for interpreting V.I.K.I.'s decisions into executable actions in the real or digital world.**
* **Conversation Log:** Archives conversation history for analytics and archival.
* **Output Manager:** Formats and delivers V.I.K.I.'s responses to users.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get V.I.K.I. up and running quickly for development and testing, we recommend using Docker Compose.

### Prerequisites

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) (Docker Engine and Docker Compose)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

### Quick Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:AppCarver/viki-va.git
    cd viki-va
    ```
2.  **Spin Up Services:**
    ```bash
    ./dev-startup.sh
    ```
    This command will build the necessary Docker images and start all the core V.I.K.I. services defined in `docker-compose.yml`.
3.  **Interact with V.I.K.I.:** (Add a simple example here once your `InputProcessor` is ready, e.g., an `curl` command or link to a test client.)

For more detailed setup instructions, including local development environments for specific services and advanced deployment options, please consult the [Deployment Documentation](/deployment/overview.md).
